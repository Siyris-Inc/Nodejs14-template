# Nodejs14-template
For use on Replit. This repository will allow you to use a Node.js 14 environment instead of the locked-in v12 there by default.

We used this to create a Discord.js v13 bot on Replit. Discord.js v13 requires Node 14 or higher.

# How to use:

- Clone the repository to a new Replit project, or simply upload the `node` file to your root directory. 

- Switch over to the shell tab in the console area and run `chmod -rwx node` to give required permissions to the file.

- Make sure your `.replit` file matches the one in this repository.

- Run your app with Node 14 features!
